# RTL generator

Generator of SystemC, VHDL and SystemVerilog projects.

# Main Idea

River CPU and peripheries libraries have different implementation versions
using differrent RTL languages (VHDL and System Verilog). I am using 
SystemC implementation as the reference model. To support consistence 
of all these implementation with the reference SystemC models I am goind to use
this RTL generator.

Suppoted languages:
    - SystemC
    - System Verilog 
    - VHDL
